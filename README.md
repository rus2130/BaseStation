# BaseStation
Parses data from https://www.ucrf.gov.ua/ua/services/centralized-registries, and provides the user with data on the number of base station registrations in Ukraine in a convenient form.
The Swift language was used for development. The data is parsed with Kanna, then saved to Core Data. The whole interface is built with SwiftUI
